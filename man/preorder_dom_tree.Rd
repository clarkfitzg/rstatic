\title{Preorder Traversal of a Tree}
\usage{
preorder_dom_tree(dom_tree, from = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{dom_tree}{(integer) The tree on which to compute a traversal, in vector
form. The value at each index should be the index of that node's parent.}

\item{from}{(integer) A node index where traversal should start.}
}
\value{
(integer) The node indexes in the order they'd be visited.
}
\description{
Given a tree in vector form, this function finds the order nodes are visited
by a preorder traversal.
}
