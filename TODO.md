# TODO

* [x] Population of parent field.
* [ ] Mutators are represented as assignment with a call as the write operand,
  but should be represented as a call to the mutator.
* [ ] Classes to represent:
    * [ ] Lists
    * [ ] Data Frames
    * [x] `(`
    * [ ] S4
    * [ ] `...`
    * [ ] Invisible
    * [ ] Functions/Closures (anonymous functions need to be carried around)
* [ ] Do we support namespace operators `::` and `:::`?
* [ ] Unit tests.
* [ ] Expansion of the data structure discussion in the README.
* [x] ? Removal of `type` field from literals (other packages can map these).
